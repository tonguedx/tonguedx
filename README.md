### Release Notes:
This is our version 1.0 release. Due to time constraints, images with later sequence IDs have been directly cropped to remove surrounding backgrounds. We are currently processing these images, and we are also extending the paper and the dataset. Detailed updates to the version 1.0 dataset and GitHub repository will continue over the coming months. Thank you for your understanding.
